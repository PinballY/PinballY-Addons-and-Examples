Category Buttons Add-In
=======================

This script adds a pair of buttons that let you navigate through your category filters with simple button presses, rather than having to go through the menu tree to get to them.
The script assigns the Left/Right Control keys as the Previous/Next Category buttons by default, but you can easily change that by editing the script
and choosing different key codes in the key event handler

Pressing the assigned Next Category button simply selects the next category filter alphabetically.  Upon reaching the last category, pressing it again switches back to the All Games
filter, then pressing it again switches to the first category alphabetically.  The Previous Category button does the same thing in reverse.

Note: this script will work best with 1.1 Beta 3 or later.
