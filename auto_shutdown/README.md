This script automatically closes PinballY and shuts down your PC if PinballY is displaying for 60 minuten the "Attract Mode".
If you have activated a general statusline - it shows the remaining time until shutdown. (technically you must have a status line, else the script might fail to launch)

Leaving the Attract Mode will automatically reset / stop the countdown.
