Batch Category Tagging
======================

This adds a new Batch Category Tagging command to the main Operator menu, which lets you add 
a category to a batch of games at once, as suggested in PinballY issue 168 (https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/issues/168).
The workflow is simple: selecting the command brings up a menu showing all of the current categories.
Selecting one of the categories takes you to a second menu with a list of all of the games.
Check or un-check each game to add or remove the category for that game.  Select Save
when done to apply the changes.
