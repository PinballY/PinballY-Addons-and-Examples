Missing Media Filter
====================

This script creates a new game list filter that selects all games with missing media.  By default, it looks for games
that are missing one or more of the main playfield media, backglass, DMD, and/or wheel icon.  You can edit the script
to add or remove media types that the filter considers significant - if you want to also include topper window media,
for example, you can easily add that to the list.

The script adds a command to activate the filter to the Operator Menu, after Show Unconfigured Games.  That seems like
the logical place for this filter to me, since I think of it as of a kind with the Hidden and Unconfigured filters, but
you can easily change it to another menu location if you prefer by editing the script.

The Missing Media filter might be useful if you want to do a quick check to look for games that you haven't finished
setting up fully.
