# menu_submenu_batch_file


This is an example script as copy pattern.
It creates a menu item.
It creates a submenu with 4 items
At the end it catches the commands and starts a batch file.

You need to adjust the script to your requirements!
In my case it triggers IObroker (smarthome) and sets the UnderCab Ambilight (WLED with ESP8266) to a preprogrammed effect.
